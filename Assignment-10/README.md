# 🧠 EAG Assignment-10: Multi-Agent Conversational Planner (MCP) System with Strategy Switching

This repository implements a complete agentic architecture that supports adaptive planning, dynamic tool execution, human-in-the-loop fallback, and simulator testing. Designed per the **Session-10 expectations of the EAG 2025 course**, it demonstrates an MCP-style agent integrated with LLM-based decision making and a robust logging/visualization stack.

---

## 🚀 1. Project Overview

This system simulates a scenario where a Conversational Agent is responsible for:
- Extracting **perception-based signals** from customer activity (e.g., Balance Drop, FD Maturity)
- Dynamically choosing between **Conservative / Exploratory / Fallback** strategies
- Executing actions through **tool invocations**
- Detecting failures and triggering **adaptive replanning**
- Invoking **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** when tools or strategies break down
- **Logging, visualizing, and archiving** each run for audit and introspection

---

## 🧠 2. Multi-Agent Roles

| Agent         | Role Description |
|---------------|------------------|
| `PerceptionAgent` | Extracts entities like `BalanceTrend`, `FDMaturityDate`, `CompetitorRates` |
| `DecisionAgent` | Creates execution plans from perceptions |
| `ExecutorAgent` | Runs tools step-by-step, handles retries, failure, replans |
| `AgentSession` | Stores tool history, logs, confidence, strategy transitions |

---

## 🧱 3. Blackboard Design

This system uses **Blackboard Architecture** with:
- Shared session memory (`AgentSession`)
- Logs: `step_history`, `plan_execution`, `tool_performance`, `confidence_levels`
- HITL tracking (`human_in_loop.log`)
- Archival & ZIP storage (`archiver.py`)

---

## 🪢 4. Strategy Profiles

| Strategy      | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Conservative  | Run one step at a time, retries on failure  |
| Exploratory   | Simulates parallel or multi-path execution  |
| Fallback      | Returns simplified or default actions       |

Switches occur based on:
- Tool failure thresholds
- Confidence drop
- Number of retries

---

## 🔄 5. Planning & Execution Lifecycle

### a. Signal → Plan Creation
```python
entities = [('BalanceTrend', 'Stable'), ('FDMaturityDate', 'No FD Found')]
plan = DecisionAgent().create_plan(entities)
```

### b. Step-by-Step Execution with Retries
- Each step = tool + params
- Retries = max 3
- Replans = max 2

### c. Strategy Switch Example
```
[STRATEGY] Conservative → Exploratory due to repeated failure of Compare FD Rates
```

### d. Replanning
- Rebuilds entire plan from same entities with updated strategy
- Logged in `strategy_transitions.log`

---

## 🔁 6. Planner Introspection

- `final_diagnostic_report.py` summarizes:
  - Total steps
  - Failures
  - Transitions
  - Summary result

- `dashboard_generator.py` shows:
  - Tool usage stats
  - Transitions
  - Step outcomes

---

## 🧪 7. Simulator Infrastructure

`simulator.py` supports:
- Randomized heuristic-based queries
- 100+ test iterations
- Summary charts via `report_generator.py`

Simulated test types:
- FD maturity + competitor rates
- FX drop detection
- Tool failures → HITL triggering
