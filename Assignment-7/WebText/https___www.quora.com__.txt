Well, I was not aware of that. I checked, and Prof. B has already listed every detail in his CV and made it publicly available. It clearly mentions his PhD degree from IIT Madras and other degrees in mathematics from the University of Madras. There appears to be no hiding of information; in fact, just going through his website gave me a headache because he has documented every small detail—unlike you Dr. Neetesh, who seems to prefer the mystery, keeping your homepage dark with links that lead nowhere. Now let’s get back to you. In a course on algorithms, it is not enough to stop at BFS, DFS, or Dijkstra’s algorithm. Even amateur content creators on YouTube are doing a better job than that these days. A minimal level of logical depth and formal analysis is expected—at the very least—in an IIT. Computer Science is built upon logical rigor, and any attempt to dilute it into mere implementation-based tutorials fundamentally betrays the discipline itself. Let me pose a simple question: How do you do Computer Science without logic or mathematics or philosophy or control theory? The very foundation of the field—whether in algorithms, complexity theory, cryptography, machine learning, or artificial intelligence—is deeply logical and mathematical. To illustrate the point, I am attaching some PhD degrees from some of the most prestigious institutions in the country. Do you see a department label? No. For a reason, it is called Doctor of Philosophy and not a phd in CSE or EE or what other fancy acronyms run in your head. This is because Computer Science has always been an interdisciplinary pursuit, driven by mathematical reasoning, logical deduction, and rigorous abstraction—not by hollow procedural knowledge. Do you see any mention of department in these degrees? If one were to blindly categorize disciplines without understanding their underlying principles, where exactly would Artificial Intelligence be placed? Under Computer Science or Data Science? If you argue for the latter, then the very list of research topics you take pride in would lose all its credibility. The pioneers of AI, cryptography, and theoretical computing were not “just” computer scientists—they were core logicians, mathematicians, physicists, and philosophers. The history of Computer Science is the history of rigorous thinkers from multiple disciplines: Alan Turing (Mathematician) laid the foundation of computability theory. John von Neumann (Mathematician and Physicist) revolutionized computing architecture. Claude Shannon (Electrical Engineer and Mathematician) invented Information Theory. Kurt Gödel (Logician and Mathematician) provided fundamental limits on computation. Alonzo Church (Mathematical Logician) developed Lambda Calculus, central to functional programming. Donald Knuth (Mathematician and Computer Scientist) formalized algorithm analysis. Richard Feynman (Physicist) played a crucial role in quantum computing. FYI, Geoffrey Hinton, widely regarded as the “Godfather of Deep Learning,” trained in experimental psychology and later pioneered neural networks, backpropagation, and deep learning by blending neuroscience, mathematics, and cognitive science. Recently, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics (a shallow mind would never be able to grasp this tenet) alongside John Hopfield for their foundational work enabling machine learning with artificial neural networks, reinforcing the profound impact of interdisciplinary research. Had he been in India, he might have been dismissed for not holding a "proper" CS degree, as the country's academic bureaucracy prioritizes rigid credentials over genuine contributions. This intellectual rigidity stifles innovation, discourages unconventional thinkers, and rewards conformity over groundbreaking research. While the rest of the world embraces interdisciplinary approaches, India's academic leadership remains trapped in political maneuvering and hierarchical gatekeeping, resulting in the country's continued lag in fundamental scientific breakthroughs. Look at where our north-east neighbors have reached in under two decades. And the list is long. Anyway let’s carry on. This is not just historical context; it is proof that Computer Science has always been rooted in mathematics and logical reasoning. Any professor who fails to incorporate these fundamental ideas into their teaching is failing their students. I am an old man, one who has spent a lifetime teaching and drawing inspiration from students. I have no grand hobbies left at this stage of life. Just waiting for my D day. But if you continue your academic treachery—if you persist in masquerading mediocrity as scholarship—then I will do what is necessary. I will analyze your so-called research, piece by piece. And you know very well what kind of storm that will unleash. Though you should not worry if any serious work was ever done. But you know better. What I expect from you is simple: Stop using others' names without their written legal consent. Focus on self-improvement instead of shallow name-dropping and politics. I want to hear a simple acknowledgement from you: that you will work on yourself and not mention others without their written permission. If not, then let’s do the dance. Let’s start with the self-proclaimed "best" paper of yours. Even a casual examination of its citations presents a concerning picture—not a single serious research lab has referenced it. Instead, it has been cited by a handful of trigger-happy students, not leading experts, citing each other in a loop of cyclic references. Let’s analyze the first line of the paper: "RAPID increase in number of vehicles, despite of limited transportation physical infrastructure, is a critical issue in development of smart cities." Beyond the grammatical errors, this opening already signals a lack of depth and technical rigor. Then, there’s the Acknowledgment section: "Dr. Neetesh Kumar would like to put his sincere thanks to the all Co-PIs of the project, ABV-IIITM Gwalior, India, and DST, IDCPS Division, India, for kind of their support." This is sloppy writing at best. And from your short bio in the paper (I sincerely hope that at least this you might have written yourself.): "He has published several research publications in worlds top tier publishers, such as IEEE journals and transactions, Elsevier, and Springer journals." This level of writing is embarrassing for someone in a premier academic institution. Given the poor writing and lack of originality, my puny mind can only deduce two possible explanations: You never actually wrote the paper—two of your students did, and you merely handled the correspondence with the publisher. In this case, putting yourself as the first author is laughable. You did all the work—in which case, I expect you to justify that placement and defend the quality of the work. Above are just opening arguments. If you insist that this paper is a significant contribution, then I will proceed to break the “math” in it down to just three fundamental points and trace every single prior work that was lifted and stitched together. If I do that, I believe you will find yourself in a pickle. This is just the beginning. After I am done exposing the fallacies in your so-called "top" papers, I will proceed to analyze the bulk of your publications—especially those in unranked conferences and low-quality journals. I am a retired man, and my only remaining purpose is to ensure that academic integrity is upheld. Rest assured, this will not be personal, nor illegal. It is my duty to provide a rigorous, open peer review—not the closed-door type, but one that the entire academic community, especially the young students of this country, can witness. They deserve to see who is truly pushing knowledge forward and who is merely occupying privileged positions while doing nothing for them. This public peer review process will take around two months. You see, I am getting old, and while your papers are not dense, they still require time and effort to dissect. But when I am done with you, I will move on to your peers—one by one. The very ones who mock the ten senior professors in your department—both in the corridors and among students—rather than focusing on improving yourself for the sake of the students and your own growth. You haven’t imagined this scenario until now sitting in your ivory tower because you’ve never dealt with people—perhaps agents—who are capable of true analysis, who will dig to the very core, and who take pleasure in dissecting science for the sheer joy of it. But if you persist in this charade, a stage will come when you will be scrambling for cover, forced to retract papers one by one—not out of choice, but out of necessity, as the weight of scrutiny becomes unbearable. And when that moment arrives, when the walls close in and retractions become inevitable, pleading for mercy may no longer make a difference. There will be no closed-door meetings, no academic protocols to shield you— only a raw, unforgiving test of whether you have ever done real science in your life . Welcome to the jungle. I will make sure this reaches every academic and student community on every social platform. There will be full publicity and a headline-worthy unveiling of what happens when self-proclaimed “top” professors fail their students and betray the standards of academia. This, however, is a last resort. I am offering you an opportunity—a chance to genuinely improve. I will be watching carefully to see whether you start making serious efforts for students and producing legitimate research. If you choose this optimal path, you may yet redeem yourself. But my fear is that your ego has outgrown your ability for self-reflection, and you will instead walk straight into your own downfall. Now that you have read the whole piece, I predict that you will delete it—just as expected. You have followed the pattern exactly as anticipated. In fact, I was joking about this with another retired buddy the other day, saying that you would post this question in a couple of days. And now, here we are—a déjà vu unfolding in real time.
